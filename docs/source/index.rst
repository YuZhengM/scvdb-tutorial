scVMAP is a user-centric database that offers intuitive workflows, customizable parameters, and comprehensive data accessibility, featuring:

1. Integrates causal variants and chromatin accessibility regions at single-cell resolution.
#. Accommodates 183 scATAC-seq samples and 15,805 fine-mapping datasets.
#. Records over 1,923,500 effective trait-sample pairs, over 13,060,000 effective trait-cell type pairs, and over 15,950,000,000 effective trait-cell pairs.
#. Provides enrichment for traits and cells or cell types.
#. Identifies relevant genes and transcription factors (TFs), as well as pathway enrichment functions of genes for the samples (including single-cell samples and traits).
#. Constructs the gene and TF hub regulatory network from traits to samples.
#. Provides epigenomic regulatory annotations related to genes, as well as a gene-relevant SNP regulatory network for specific traits.
#. Establishes an SNP-associated regulatory network.
#. Offers comprehensive download resources.
#. Publishes full-stack development code.
#. Provides API interfaces for data access.
