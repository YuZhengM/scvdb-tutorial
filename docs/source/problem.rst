4. Problem
===========================

Here we will answer common questions.

If you have any other questions that need to be answered, you can send an email to ``yuzmbio@163.com``.
Alternatively, you can ask questions on Github `scvdb-tutorial <https://github.com/YuZhengM/scvdb-tutorial>`_.

4.1 There is a problem accessing the website
----------------------------------------------

Occasionally, we update information on the website, which may be due to conflicts between the previously cached data and newly published content.
Therefore, you need to ``clear the cache and access it again``.

.. note::

    The probability of this happening is relatively low. If clearing the cache does not solve the problem after it occurs, please contact us in a timely manner. Thank you for your contribution.

.. tip::

    If you have accessed the SCVdb database link before July 19, 2025, it is recommended to clear the cache and access again.

4.2 Publicize front-end and back-end code
----------------------------------------------

 | SCVdb front-end: https://github.com/YuZhengM/scvdb_web
 | SCVdb back-end: https://github.com/YuZhengM/scvdb

We have released the full stack development code for the SCVdb database, which is very useful for bioinformatics database development.
Users can directly download and use them to develop bioinformatics database websites.

At least mastering ``Vue`` and ``Spring Boot`` frameworks is necessary to start practical application.
