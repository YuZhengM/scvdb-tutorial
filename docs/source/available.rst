1. What information is available in SCVdb?
==============================================

Genome-wide association studies in combination with single-cell genomic
atlases can provide insights into the mechanisms of genetic variation.
Fine-mapping refines this to pinpoint causal variants and more precisely
decode disease mechanisms. The advent of single-cell assay for transposase-accessible
chromatin through sequencing (scATAC-seq),
which employs co-localization and random walk techniques alongside fine-mapping,
allows for the regulation and tagging of cell types with genetic variants,
elucidating their role in cellular contexts. Some algorithms like g-chromVAR
and SCAVENGE have been developed that effectively elucidate the roles and
impacts of genetic variations at the single-cell level. However, they face
limitations like less user-friendly analysis workflows, time-intensive, and
reliance on high-performance computing. These challenges hinder biologists
from widely investigating the single-cell genetic variations, urgently calling
for a user-friendly online analysis tool. Thus, we developed
`SCVdb <https://bio.liclab.net/scvdb/>`_, the first
online and user-friendly server for variant-to-function mapping at single-cell resolution.

Here, we have developed a network database platform (SCVdb, https://bio.liclab.net/scvdb/)
for integrating single-cell chromatin accessibility regions with causal variants.
The aim is to provide a large amount of available resources on human single-cell
chromatin accessibility data and fine-mapping causal variant data, as well as an
analysis platform for the integrated results of the two.
