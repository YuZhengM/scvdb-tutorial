3.5 Analysis
================


Different analysis functions correspond to different analytical perspectives,
meeting the needs of various analysis users. The first analysis approaches
from a forward perspective by integrating scATAC-seq samples with causal
variant data. The second analysis explores the regulatory processes of
integrating scATAC-seq samples with causal variant data by using genes
as a hub. The third analysis investigates the regulatory processes of
integrating scATAC-seq samples with causal variant data by using transcription
factors as a hub.
