2.3.3  Search information by gene
=================================

 | Link: https://bio.liclab.net/scvdb/search

Users can submit a gene of interest search to access scATAC-seq data and fine-mapping result data associated with this gene.

The results are divided into four parts, as follows:

1. Gene details and number of traits enriched by genes under different reference genome backgrounds.

.. note::

    The scATAC-seq sample data of associated genes is the most relaxed standard, without any strict threshold. Specific information needs to be accessed by clicking on the ``Sample ID`` to enter the "Detail" page.
