3.2 Data-browse
================

The "Data-browse" page of SCVdb
provides users with options for single-cell samples and
fine-mapping results to access detailed data. Single cell datasets
are further divided into sample or cell type based access data.

The displayed information content supports interactive tables,
alphabetical sorting, and can be searched for the desired records
using Search. After the user clicks on the **Sample ID** or **Trait or disease ID**
of interest, detailed information will be displayed on the new webpage.
